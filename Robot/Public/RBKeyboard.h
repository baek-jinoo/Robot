/*! Wraps UIKit's keyboard implementation. This provides an

 *  actions through this interface will properly go through text input
 *  flow (eg - UITextField delegate calls).
 *
 *  Other non-English keyboard are not tested and may or may not work.
 *  Custom keyboard are not tested with this and will probably NOT work with this.
 *
 *  Currently, Robot triggers NSNotification events only trigger for iOS 8+.
 *
 *  Uses private APIs.
 *
 *  @warning be sure to dismiss the keyboard after usage to avoid
 *           dangling UI components that are awaiting keyboard input.
